<h3>About the Creator:</h3>
  <div class="par">
    <p>
      From the very beginning I enjoyed working with my hands and creating. I watched so many DIY videos as a kid. I remember thinking this is easy or I could do that. But when I tried it turned out to be very different from what I expected. I have memories of making beaded bracelets with my cousins and tying friendship bracelets with friends. Over time my passion grew and I got better with practice. Whenever a friend's or family member's birthday came up I created some type of jewelry for them using their favorite colors and adding a charm they could relate to. I always love seeing their faces when they open it. That was the best part, seeing that they enjoyed what I enjoyed making. A win win. When I saw how much they liked my jewelry I wanted to open an Etsy shop. But the things I made were not shop quality, they had lots of tiny mistakes.

      Over a couple years later I refined my crafting skills getting new tools and getting the methods down until I felt that I could actually sell what I make. That day I rushed to the bank to get my first checking account with my dad. Once I opened this shop I was overwhelmed with filling all the boxes and information out but I am getting better at it slowly, steadily. I hope to see my small shop grow over time.

      The reason I chose to call my shop SmallStartBigHeart is simple. I had a small start that my dad helped me out with. He helped me see the things I could do better. The big heart part is there because I love being able to share my creations with other people.
